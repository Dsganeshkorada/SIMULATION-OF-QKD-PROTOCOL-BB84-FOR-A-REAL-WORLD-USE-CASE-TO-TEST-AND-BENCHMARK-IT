# SIMULATION-OF-QKD-PROTOCOL-BB84-FOR-A-REAL-WORLD-USE-CASE-TO-TEST-AND-BENCHMARK-IT
This project aims to simulate the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol to validate and compare its performance for practical implementation. BB84 is a basic quantum cryptographic technique that facilitates secure exchange of cryptographic keys between two parties using the principles of quantum mechanics.
